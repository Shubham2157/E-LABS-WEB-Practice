                All Website.com fees and charges are quoted and billed in US Dollars unless otherwise noted.

                Members have the option to pay services fees in Canadian Dollars or US Dollars. 
                
                If Canadian Dollars is selected as the billing currency, Members will be charged the Canadian Dollar 
                
                equivalent of the US Dollar total. The exchange rate used ("Exchange Rate") is subject to change 
                
                from time to time and can always be found on the Website.com

                Website.com uses an automated payment processing system and only accepts credit card
                 or PayPal payments at this time. All Subscribers are required to maintain valid payment information 
                 on file for the processing of any applicable service fees. At its sole discretion, Website.com may use
                  credit card issuer-approved services, such as VISA Account Updater and MasterCard Automatic Billing Updater,
                   to acquire updated payment information for the purpose of processing outstanding payments that are on your account.
                
                Website.com may take any reasonable action to validate your payment and registration information, and collect 
                all payments due. You agree to pay all attorney and collection fees arising from any efforts to collect any past
                 due amounts from you, to the extent allowed by law.
                
                Service fees are due at the time of order or on the day of renewal. All fees must be paid in full.
                
                Invoices for all Website.com services can be found by logging into your account control panel.
                
                Billing inquiries and disputes should be brought to Website.com's attention within 30 days of the invoice date.
                 Failure to do so will be deemed to be an admission that the invoice and charges are accurate.
                
                If any chargeback or charge dispute notices are received for your account, services provided to you may be
                 immediately suspended pending investigation, and you will be subject to chargeback service charges. Where applicable,
                 
                 Website.com reserves the right to put your domain name into "Registrar Hold" status and deny any transfer requests
                  for that domain name until the chargeback or dispute issue has been resolved.<br><br>
